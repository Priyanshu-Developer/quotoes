Doubt thou the stars are fire;  Doubt that the sun doth move;  Doubt truth to be a liar;  But never doubt I love.      +William Shakespeare
Love is not breathlessness, it is not excitement, it is not the desire to mate every second of the day. It is not lying awake at night imagining that he is kissing every part of your body. . . .

True love, like any other strong and addicting drug, is boring — once the tale of encounter and discovery is told, kisses quickly grow stale and caresses tiresome . . . except, of course, to those who share the kisses, who give and take the caresses while every sound and color of the world seems to deepen and brighten around them.

And, as is true of any other strong and addicting drug, true first love is dangerous.      +Stephen King

Love is not breathlessness, it is not excitement, it is not the desire to mate every second of the day. It is not lying awake at night imagining that he is kissing every part of your body. . . .

What we mean by “love” is the love of a person, the exclusive love of a particular person. . . . Love requires specific focus, not global perspective or random aim. It is not a fund of affection which we can distribute as we will.

Solomon
There is only one serious question. And that is: . . . how to make love stay?      + Tom Robbins

True love, like any other strong and addicting drug, is boring — once the tale of encounter and discovery is told, kisses quickly grow stale and caresses tiresome . . . except, of course, to those who share the kisses, who give and take the caresses while every sound and color of the world seems to deepen and brighten around them. As with any other strong drug, true first love is really only interesting to those who have become its prisoners. And, as is true of any other strong and addicting drug, true first love is dangerous.      +Stephen King
Love consists of this: two solitudes that meet, protect and greet each other.      +Rainer Maria Rilke

Doubt thou the stars are fire;  Doubt that the sun doth move;  Doubt truth to be a liar;  But never doubt I love.      +William Shakespeare
Love is not breathlessness, it is not excitement, it is not the desire to mate every second of the day. It is not lying awake at night imagining that he is kissing every part of your body. . . . Love itself is what is left over, when being in love has burned away. Doesn’t sound very exciting, does it? But it is!      +Louis de Bernières
One hour of right down love is worth an age of dully living on.      +Aphra Benn

Love: a single word, a wispy thing, a word no bigger or longer than an edge. That’s what it is: an edge, a razor. It draws up through the center of your life, cutting everything in two. Before and after. The rest of the world falls away on either side.      +Lauren Oliver

I loved her against reason, against promise, against peace, against hope, against happiness, against all discouragement that could be.      +Charles Dickens
I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where,  I love you directly without problems or pride:  I love you like this because I don’t know any other way to love,  except in this form in which I am not nor are you,  so close that your hand upon my chest is mine,  so close that your eyes close with my dreams.      +Pablo Neruda

It is not love. It is the force of evolution expressed as the compulsion for the particular, this particular one above all others. Often, it is called love. . . .      +Dorothy Tennov
What we mean by “love” is the love of a person, the exclusive love of a particular person. . . . Love requires specific focus, not global perspective or random aim. It is not a fund of affection which we can distribute as we will. In legal terms, one would say that lovers are essentially non-fungible—they cannot be replaced with another of the same style and make like a broken toaster or a worn-out Oldsmobile.      +Robert C. Solomon
There is only one serious question. And that is: . . . how to make love stay?      + Tom Robbins

Love is a drama of contradictions.      +Franz Kafka
When we love someone, we should look deeply into the nature of that love. If we want to be with someone so that we can feel safe, that’s understandable, but it’s not true love. True love doesn’t foster suffering or attachment. On the contrary, it brings well-being to ourselves and to others. True love is generated from within. For true love to be there, you need to feel complete in yourself, not needing something from outside. True love is like the sun, shining with its own light, and offering that light to everyone.      +Thich Nhat Hanh
'Love' is a beautiful word, and we have to restore its meaning. When we say, 'I love hamburgers,' we spoil the word. We have to make the effort to heal words by using them properly and carefully. True love includes a sense of responsibility and accepting the other person as she is, with all her strengths and weaknesses. If you only like the best things in a person, that is not love. You have to accept her weaknesses and bring your patience, understanding, and energy to help her transform. This kind of love brings protection and safety.      +Thich Nhat Hanh
Love is the acute awareness of the impossibility of possession.      +Arnold Pernes
Love is in fact quite ordinary, less than cosmic, not the answer to all of life’s problems and sometimes calamitous.      +Robert C. Solomon
Fear unchecked grows exponentially. Love poured forth has the power to remove it.      +Marianne Williamson
To love is indeed nothing else than to crave something for its own sake.      +St. Augustine
